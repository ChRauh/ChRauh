You have landed on the GitHub of Christian Rauh.
    
I am an empirical political scientist, working as a senior researcher in the Global Governance unit of the [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/en/persons/christian-rauh), as a Professor for the â€˜Politics of Multilevel Governanceâ€™ at the [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/wiso/faculty/departments/political-and-administrative-science), and as a consultant for data science projects in the political domain.

My [empirical work](https://chrauh.github.io/data-and-resources.html) is typically based on original (often: web-based) *data collection*, advanced quantitative *text analysis / NLP methods*, and targeted *data visualization*.    
    
I'm working mostly with ***R***, a bit of web tools (shiny, HTML, CSS), and - slowly, but increasingly - Python.

If you want to learn more or reach out, please see my **[website](www.christian-rauh.eu)**.
